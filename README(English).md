# Statistical-Analysis-VRAM-Usage

Project for the Statistics and Probability course in the undergraduate program [Information Systems (IS)](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/graduacao/sistemas-de-informacao/) at [Center for Informatics (CIN)](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/) of [Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE)](https://www.ufpe.br/), a course taken by me in 2023.

In this repository, the [Python](https://www.python.org) language was used to perform T student tests, using the [SciPy](https://scipy.org) library.

## Course Syllabus

Descriptive Statistics; Probability; Inferential Statistics. Events. Random experiments. Sampling theory.

## File Organization

- The file `project.py` contains the project code.

- The file `TRUE VISION - GROUP 6.pdf` contains the slides used in the presentation.

- The file `MEMORY.txt` contains the dataset used in the project.

- The file `Report_Project_IF971_2023_1__Group_6_.pdf` is the project report.

- The file `Project_Specification_2023.1.pdf` contains the information, specifications, and rules for the project.

## Project Proposal

The project aimed to evaluate the team in an analysis of the data provided by the professor. The team performed descriptive data analysis and statistical hypotheses. The data context is not real and was invented by the professor and the team.

Tasks included: Completing the project, creating a project report, presenting the project to the class and the professor.

Summary of the report:

This report addresses the growing relevance of augmented reality in the global scenario, focusing on the analysis of VRAM (Video Random Access Memory) usage during image rendering in a tourism project called "True Vision." This project aims to allow users to explore tourist sites virtually in real-time, promoting the culture and history of each location. Thus, the research in this study aims to propose the server memory plan that best serves the company's service provision. The research process was divided into three phases: data collection, data analysis, and hypothesis formulation. Data collection involved continuous monitoring of VRAM usage on a server. Data analysis was conducted manually and with the help of statistical tools. Three hypotheses were formulated, including checking the normality of the data, estimating the mean VRAM usage at 500 MB, and analyzing to ensure that the server operates below the overload zone (80% of the maximum VRAM capacity). Therefore, the study aims to provide fundamental information for the appropriate choice of the server's VRAM plan to ensure better details for the startup's financial plans and the efficient operation of the application.
